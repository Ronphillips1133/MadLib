madLib = f"You are in for a treat! Today I will be telling you the rules to play {name} ball. \
First you must gather three {plural_noun} and set them in a triangle shape. Those will be bases. \
You begin by going to the first base and {verb_ending_in_ing} for {number_a} seconds. \
Immediatley after you finish you must run {adverb} to second base, but watch out! \
While you are trying to get there, your opponent will try and throw a {noun_a} \
at you. If it hits you, then you are out, If you make it, you should feel very {adjective_a} \
because you have just scored {number_b} points. \
Next you nust make it from second base to third base. This part is TRICKY. Using only your {body_part} \
you must get a {noun_c} sized ball into a basket, before you can run. \
Once you make it in the basket, make sure to take off running as fast as a \
{animal} towards the final base. If you make it safely, you are one step away from victory. \
Once on the Last Base, It is time to FOCUS as you will need to steal a {noun_c} \
from your oppent as they try to avoid you. Once you have it, you win and can be crowned as a \
{adjective_b} Champion!"
